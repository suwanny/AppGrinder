<filter> is the name of a class that implements                                 
net.grinder.tools.tcpproxy.TCPProxyFilter or one of NONE, ECHO. The default is  
ECHO. Multiple filters can be specified for each stream.                        
                                                                                
By default, the TCPProxy listens as an HTTP/HTTPS Proxy on                      
<localhost:localport>.                                                          
                                                                                
If either -remotehost or -remoteport is specified, the TCPProxy acts a simple   
port forwarder between <localhost:localport> and <remotehost:remoteport>.       
Specify -ssl for SSL support.                                                   
                                                                                
-http sets up request and response filters to produce a test script suitable for
use with the HTTP plugin. The output can be customised by specifying the file   
name of an alternative XSLT style sheet.                                        
                                                                                
-timeout is how long the TCPProxy will wait for a request before timing out and 
freeing the local port. The TCPProxy will not time out if there are active      
connections.                                                                    
                                                                                
-console displays a simple control window that allows the TCPProxy to be        
shutdown cleanly. This is needed because some shells, e.g. Cygwin bash, do not  
allow Java processes to be interrupted cleanly, so filters cannot rely on       
standard shutdown hooks.                                                        
                                                                                
-httpproxy and -httpsproxy allow output to be directed through another          
HTTP/HTTPS proxy; this may help you reach the Internet. These options are not   
supported in port forwarding mode.                                              
                                                                                
Typical usage:
